<strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong><br><br>CalOPPA is the 
first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services 
to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to 
require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) 
that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from 
California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating 
exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with 
whom it is being shared. - See more at: 
http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>
<br>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br>Users can visit our site 
anonymously.<br>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on 
our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our 
website.<br>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily 
be found on the page specified above.<br><br>You will be notified of any Privacy

place.<br><br><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong><br>
It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking<br>
<br><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong><br><br>When 
it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age 
of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts 
parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer 
protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of 
websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety 
online.<br><br><strong>We do not specifically market to children under the age 
of 13 years old.</strong><br>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or 
plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?<br><br><strong>Fair Information 
Practices</strong><br><br>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the 
backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have 
played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the 
globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they 
should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that 
protect personal information.<br><br>In order to be in line with Fair 
Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a 
data breach occur:<br>We will notify you via email<br>• Within 7 business days<br>
We will notify the users via in-site notification<br>• Within 7 business day<br>
<br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that 
individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data 
collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires 
not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also 
that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate 
and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
